              Career Guidance and Counselling Unit of Bayero University is
              established to provide essential guidance and counselling services
              to students, staff both academic and non-academic to manage their
              life challenges be it psychological, personal, social, educational
              and vocational.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Unit is in collaboration with external agencies as well as
              colleges, centres, faculties, departments, units and other
              administrative staff of the university to get access to students
              who need guidance and counselling services to benefit from
              academic, health and other vital services provided by the
              university.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be more specific the unit in collaboration with the university
              management and other units organize annual orientation service to
              students, newly recruited staff and retiring staff to help them
              maximize their benefits during and after their academic life in
              the university.
            </p>
            <p>
              The university provides a range of services that enhances
              students’ development but unfortunately many students lack
              awareness of benefitting from such services. That what made it
              necessary to embark on sensitization mission to members of the
              university community on the need of guidance and counselling for
              smooth transition in life.
            </p>
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the psycho-educational crisis that many students are
            battling with for proper adjustment and building good inter personal
            relationship with other members of the university community is being
            handled and managed by the staff of the unit who are always
            available to offer the best counselling services needed. Some issues
            related to behaviour disorders are also handled by the use of
            relevant and effective counselling interventions.{" "}
